when user click to the product icon which he/she is trying to buy then it will move to the product section and in that section user will be able to see the product details along with its price, in this section user can sort the items based on the price, rating whatever the needs of the user.

when the user added some items to the cart then he/she can easily see the items in the cart section along with its total price, here the user can add some discount coupon also to get some more items.

here the user needs to provide the address where the items will be delivered and user can also check the address during the checkout time to confirm whether the user has given the correct address or not.
